Euclid's Algorithm project:

A Python implementation of Euclid's Algorithm that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers. 
The program includes a step-by-step visualization of the algorithm's execution through an interactive table display.

## Features

- Interactive user input for two numbers
- Automatic handling of input order (swaps if divisor is smaller than numerator)
- Step-by-step visualization table showing:
  - Quotient (q)
  - First number (m)
  - Second number (n)
  - Remainder (r)
- Clear display of final GCD result
- Error handling for negative numbers
